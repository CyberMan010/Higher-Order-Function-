# Higher-Order-Function-
*This is one of the most joyable manipulation exercises you could have done*  
# Task-1:
_you should make an array and exchange any number you put in and multiplie it by 2 , therefore you need to finish it with 3 ways (map,foreach and for methods)_

# Task-2:
_Use loop and map to bring back a new array with decleration of each input whetherwise it's integer or string(integers should be defined by even or odd)_

# Task-3:
_I choosed forEach because I tried map() in Task one , this task was simple and I learnt how to display name through the array_

# Task-4:
_This one seems like a game , I tried to make a for loop first ,therefore it didn't work for me ,so I tried another way with if statement and forEach so if the number in the input can be divisible by 3 it says Fizz if it was with 5 it says Buzz , if both it says FizzBuzz and give us an output_
